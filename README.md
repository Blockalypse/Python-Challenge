# Python_Analysis_of_Voter_Election_Data

This is a process of modernizing a voting process using Python. I imported a csv named “election_data” the dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.  Then I, created a python script (main.py) that analyzed the vote by: total number of votes cast, and the percentage of votes each candidate received.
